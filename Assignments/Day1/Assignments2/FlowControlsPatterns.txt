control statements and loops

1. (Game: lottery) to generate a lottery of a threedigit
number. The program prompts the user to enter a three-digit number and
determines whether the user wins according to the following rules:
1. If the user input matches the lottery number in the exact order, the award is
$10,000.
2. If all the digits in the user input match all the digits in the lottery number, the
award is $3,000.
3. If one digit in the user input matches a digit in the lottery number, the award is
$1,000.



2. (Count positive and negative numbers and compute the average of numbers) Write
a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how many
positive and negative values have been read, and computes the total and average of
the input values (not counting zeros). Your program ends with the input 0. Display
the average as a floating-point number. Here is a sample run:
Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0:1 2 -1 3 0
The number of positives is 3
The number of negatives is 1
The total is 5
The average is 1.25

or

Enter an integer, the input ends if it is 0:
No numbers are entered except 0
0

3.(Display four patterns using loops) Use nested loops that display the following
patterns in four separate programs:
Pattern A        Pattern B  Pattern C    Pattern D
1       	1 2 3 4 5 6       1 	1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2     	1 2 3 4 5       2 1   	  1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3   	1 2 3 4       3 2 1         1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 	1 2 3       4 3 2 1           1 2 3
1 2 3 4 5 	1 2 	  5 4 3 2 1 	    	1 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 	1 	6 5 4 3 2 1 	          1
